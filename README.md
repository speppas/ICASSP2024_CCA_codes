## BINARY SIGNAL ALIGNMENT: OPTIMAL SOLUTION IS POLYNOMIAL-TIME AND LINEAR-TIME SOLUTION IS QUASI-OPTIMAL

## Description
This repository contains MATLAB scripts developed for the analysis of the paper with title: BINARY SIGNAL ALIGNMENT: OPTIMAL SOLUTION IS POLYNOMIAL-TIME AND LINEAR-TIME SOLUTION IS QUASI-OPTIMAL accepted on ICASSP conference 2024. Methods, such as Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) are tested under different modulation schemes i.e. BPSK and 4QAM. The scripts include testbeds for SNR experiments also for exhaustive search and rank-deficient framework (for binary vectors). Additionally, the repository includes generic scripts for gCCA, nearest neighbor algorithm, and rank-SNR-SINR evaluation.
