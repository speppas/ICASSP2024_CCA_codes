## BINARY SIGNAL ALIGNMENT: OPTIMAL SOLUTION IS POLYNOMIAL-TIME AND LINEAR-TIME SOLUTION IS QUASI-OPTIMAL

## Description
This repository contains MATLAB scripts developed for the analysis of the paper with title: BINARY SIGNAL ALIGNMENT: OPTIMAL SOLUTION IS POLYNOMIAL-TIME AND LINEAR-TIME SOLUTION IS QUASI-OPTIMAL accepted on ICASSP conference 2024. Methods, such as Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) are tested under different modulation schemes i.e. BPSK and 4QAM. The scripts include testbeds for SNR experiments also for exhaustive search and rank-deficient framework (for binary vectors). Additionally, the repository includes generic scripts for gCCA, nearest neighbor algorithm, and rank-SNR-SINR evaluation.

## Installation
To use these scripts, MATLAB must be installed on your system. No additional toolboxes are required. Simply clone the repository or download the scripts to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/speppas/ICASSP2024_CCA_codes.git
```
## Usage

Each script in this repository corresponds to a different testbed or algorithm:

- `SNR_testbeds_CCA_4QAM.m`: Testbed for CCA with 4QAM modulation.
- `SNR_testbeds_CCA_BPSK.m`: Testbed for CCA with BPSK modulation.
- [...additional descriptions for each script...]

To run a script, open it in MATLAB and execute. Ensure you are in the correct directory or adjust your MATLAB path accordingly.
